This is my [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) bucket, containing manifests of my open source projects.

## How do I install these manifests?

Identify the manifest you want to use and run:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add BabysnakesDev https://github.com/babysnakes/scoop-bucket
scoop install BabysnakesDev/<manifestname>
```
